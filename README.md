# Project Todos

Simple Todo list web app made to get familiar with Redux.

## The problem

I was moving this week so I was a bit short on time, that's why I decided to keep it rather simple. There was a lot of functionality I thought of that I didn't have time to even try to implement (like sorting tasks after category, date added etc.). Even thoughI-t really helped me understanding Redux a bit better. I also went back to look at the code for the quiz project (all the reducers and some of the selectors were already there when we started on that project) and was happy to find that I understood it way better now. 

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
