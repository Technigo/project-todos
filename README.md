# Project Todos

Todo application with react and redux

## The problem

JS, React, Redux, Styled components, material-ui

The biggest challenge was to understand redux. With the help of codealongs and class lectures I could make a todo list where I could add and remove tasks
I then worked on the checkbox
Styling is hard but it was more fun with material-ui
