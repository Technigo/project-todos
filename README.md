# Project Todos

A project using Redux to build a Todo app, where it's possible to add tasks, list tasks and toggle whether a task is done or not, a counter that counts the number of tasks and whats left todo, as well as a clear all button, built using reducers, dispatch and useSelector.


Learning objectives:
* The role redux-toolkit plays
* How to create new slices
* How to create new reducers
* How to create new actions
* What immutability means and how to work with it
* How to structure a redux store
* How to write reducers and actions
* How to interact with your store using selectors or by dispatching actions


 My next *Todo* would be to implement that when tasks been marked as complete it would move to the bottom of the list.


Technologies Implemented: Redux, React, JSX, CSS
