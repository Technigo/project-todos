A simple todo-app created using React, Redux and styled components. You can add and remove specific tasks, check them off, and remove all tasks. There is also a task counter that keeps track of how many tasks you have completed, and gives you a congratulatory alert when you've checked all your tasks.

## The problem

I still struggle a bit with understanding the logic of Redux, but I did get the most important features of the project off the ground. The biggest challenge for me this week was the styling and the animations, as I decided to go for a glassmorphism look to my project. It did work out well but it was definitely a bit of an ambitious plan for the timeframe that I had.
