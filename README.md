Project Todos - https://hannah-project-to-do.netlify.app/

🏁 Goals:

I was tasked with building a to do app using React, Redux and I have successfully completed what I set out to do.

The app has three main functionalities - adding tasks, listing tasks, and toggling task completion status. I decided to keep the design quite simple as I did not wan't it to be overly complex. 

Overall, I found this project to be a great opportunity to flex my Redux muscles and bring together all the different parts of Redux. I am please with the end result, even though I might have gone down another road design wise if I had time to redo the App. I'm looking forward to using the skills and knowledge I gained from this project in future endeavors.

Must-have requirements:

✅ List all tasks - completed or uncompleted.

✅ Be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncompleted).

✅ Be able to add and remove tasks.

✅ Should show a count of either all tasks or all uncompleted tasks (or both).

🚧 The problem:

I started with creating a design sketch in Figma - the plan was to create a minimal and lightweight app.
Then I set the structure with components and reducers.
I used styled components for some parts of the styling in this project. 

If I had more time, I would add a "Complete all" button.
