# Project Todos

Project making a Todo app using react redux store with global states & reducers.

## The problem

Started trying to figues out how I wanted the layout to be then continued on making up the store, components and reducers. Used styled components for the CSS and moment.js for the time presented.

If I had more time I would've wanted to maybe make categories and deadlines for the todos.
