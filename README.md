# Project Todos

This project is a to-do app built using Redux/Redux-toolkit in React. The focus was on structuring the redux store and creating reducers, slices and actions.

## The problem

The first step was to plan out what the app would look like, the components needed, the reducers needed for each action and from there to create a redux store. Then I looked into how each component dispatched the necessary actions.
I found help on StackOverflow and from other team members. 
If I had more time, I would have liked to implement the ability to create projects to encompass the different tasks with their categories.
