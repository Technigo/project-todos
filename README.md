# Project Todos ✔️✔️🖊️

The goal of this project is to build a To Do application with the following functionalities: add/remove a task, list a new task and toggle between done/not done. 
This had to be achieved by using Redux and and Redux's state to manage features and create my own store with reducers and actions. This was achieved by using **Redux Toolkit**.

## The problem

It was very important to start by thinking and defining which and how many components I needed to create the app according to how I wanted it to look like and the features that I was going to implement. 
<ul>
  <list>Coding wise, I started by configuring my store with an initial state. I chose to display 4 tasks.I started with a **reducer** to store the initial state </list>
</ul>
