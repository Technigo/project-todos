# Project Todos

A project which pulls together all the parts od Redux in a todo app. 

## The problem

The aim of the project was to practice writing a reducers and actions as well as structuring a redux store. To interact with the Redux store I practiced using selectors and dispatching actions. To add some more versatility to the app I added the option of creating projects for the user to group tasks in different todo lists.
