# Project Todos

This project is a todo app built using Redux. The user can add and remove tasks and toggle weather a task is done or not. In the header the date and the number of total tasks is displayed. 


## The problem

The app is built with 4 components. A todolist, single todo, a form to add a new todo, and a header. 
I applied the styling provided in the project brief where the most challenging part was the styling of the checkmarks. 
Mobile first design - no media queries added yet. 

When I have more time I want to add a button for deleting the todolist as well as showing remaining todos.
