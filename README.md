# Project Todos

The goal of this project was to create a todo app, where the user can add and list tasks, and toggle the tasks between completed and uncompleted state.

## The problem

I started the project by doing a rough sketch which showcased the layout of the app and which components I wanted to include in it. I started by creating a slice and reducers for storing and modifying the tasks and creating the components for adding new tasks and listing them. After that I added different functionalities for filtering and sorting the tasks. In the end I did the styling using styled components.

With more time I would have liked to create a new slice for storing the user info to the store and add an empty state component.
