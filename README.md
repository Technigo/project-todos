## Project Brief
Flex your redux muscles and build an application that pulls together all the parts of redux by building a to do app.

## Project requirements 

- [x] Ideate, design, plan and execute this project. 
- [x] Use Redux Toolkit to create new slices, reducers and actions.
- [x] Your app should list all tasks - completed or uncompleted.
- [x]  You should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncompleted).
- [x]  You should be able to add and remove tasks.
- [x]  Your app should show a count of either all tasks or all uncompleted tasks (or both).

# Running Locally

This is a short guide on how to run a Redux quiz project locally.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine
- A code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the project dependencies including `react-redux`, `@reduxjs/toolkit`, and `react-router-dom`.

## Running the Project

1. After the installation is complete, run `npm start` to start the development server.
2. Once the server is started, you can view the project in your web browser by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

That's it! You now have the Redux project up and running on your local machine with all the required dependencies installed.
