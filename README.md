# Project Todos

The goal of this project was to create a todo app, where the user can add and list tasks, and toggle them between completed or uncompleted state.

## The problem

I started the project by doing a rough sketch which showcased the layout of the app and which components I wanted to include in it. I started by creating the components for adding new tasks and listing them. After that I continued by adding different functionalities for filtering and sorting the tasks. In the end I did the styling for the app. 

With more time I would have liked to pass the name of the user to the global state and add an empty state component.
