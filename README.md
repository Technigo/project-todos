# Project Todos

**Brief**
In this week's project, it's time to flex your redux muscles and build an application that pulls together all the parts of redux by building a to do app.

**What you need to do**
✓ Your app should list all tasks - completed or uncompleted.
✓ You should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncompleted).
✓ You should be able to add and remove tasks.
✓ Your app should show a count of either all tasks or all uncompleted tasks (or both).

## The problem

Started the week by going through materials and did code along. Decided to do a minimalistic design and to use UI materials for this project instead of css / styled components.

Got started on the project through the recording of live session and did one piece at a time before moving on to the next.
