# Project Todos

This project is a todo app build in React and Redux toolkit. I also used customized css and styled components.

I really enjoyed working with Redux toolkit, although it was a bit tricky from times to times.
I learned a lot by testing out different features and I will fefinitley add some more features to it!

## The problem

I started to do the prototype in Figma. Then I moved on to solve the basic requirements:

- List all todo tasks - completed or uncompleted
- It should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncomplete)
- It should be able to add and remove tasks
- The app should show a count of either all todos or all uncomplete todos (or both)

To this I added several features:

- A timestamp for when the task is created (or updated)
- A complete button to set all task completed.
- A delete button to delete all tasks.
- Saving LocalStorage
- An empty state page.
- Toggle for dark and light mode.

Next to do is:

- Add categories
- Add prioritizing
- Add sorting functions
- Add due date
- Add a warning when clicking on "delete all"
