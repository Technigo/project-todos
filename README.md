# Project Todos

In this week's project, it's time to flex your redux muscles and build an application which pulls together all the parts of redux by building a todo app.

In my todo app, you should be able to add tasks, list tasks and toggle whether a task is done or not. I was free to style my todo list however I'd like, but "try to keep it simple and clean" 

## The problem

I was struggling so much to style my checkboxes. It was really hard, and I look at many tutorials. 
And now is it the thing I am most proud of in this project.

## Learning objectives

- How to structure a redux store
- How to write reducers and actions
- How to interact with your store using selectors or by dispatching actions

## Tech

- React
- JSX
- Redux
