# Project Todos

This week we where tasked with creating a Todo-list website, in React Redux
where you can add todos and remove them as you please.

## The problem

I learned more about redux, and how the get and send information to the "store". 
The problems where making it work, making so you can add todos and remove them.
I watch the live session, and googled. 

If i had more time:
- i would add a timestamp for when the todos were created
- and a remove all button to get a clean state
- i would put more effort into styling

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
