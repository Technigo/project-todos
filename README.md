What immutability means and how to work with it

- How to structure a redux store
- How to write reducers and actions
- How to interact with your store using selectors or by dispatching actions

- Your app should list all todo tasks - completed or uncompleted
- You should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncomplete)
- You should be able to add and remove tasks
- Your app should show a count of either all todos, or all uncomplete todos (or both)
- Add a **clear all** button to set all tasks to *done* status. You could also use this opportunity to make your app look nice when there's no data. See [empty states UX design](https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/empty-state-ux-design) for some ideas.
