To-Do App

This web app is a todo-list. You can list stuff that you need to do or things you need to buy and keep track during the day how many tasks you have left and which of them you have completed.

I built it in React and this was the first time I set up Redux which I used to store the to-do-input and to keep track of when states changed.

It was overall a fun project and I would like to add on more categories eventually, or some other features like an event planner/calender.
