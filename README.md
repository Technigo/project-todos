# Project Todos

Build an application that pulls together all the parts of redux by building a to do app.

✓ Your app should list all tasks - completed or uncompleted.
✓ You should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncompleted).
✓ You should be able to add and remove tasks.
✓ Your app should show a count of either all tasks or all uncompleted tasks (or both).

## The problem

The functionality is there but the styling has to be done.
