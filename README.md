# Project Todos

With the help of React-Redux I created this simple to do list which displays:

- Current date
- Amount of tasks in total
- Amount of tasks completed
- Amount of tasks left
- Input field and submit button
- Local storage
- Checkbox if completed, delete button if deleted
- Date of when the task was created.

## The problem

With the help of online resources, working in a pair and lectures I tried to start with the assignment as fast as possible.

If i had more time i would implement more styling. something i have a hard time to do.

These are the requriements i aimed for:

\*\*- Your app should list all todo tasks - completed or uncompleted

- You should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncomplete)
- You should be able to add and remove tasks
- Your app should show a count of either all todos, or all uncomplete todos (or both)\*\*
