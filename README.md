# Project Todos

A todo app built using React Redux.

## Approach

By default, the initial state in the store is empty (and the EmptyState component gets mounted). On Redux state change, the state is stored in localstorage & used as the new initial state. Reducers & actions are handling states such as adding items to the list, deleting items, completing items and clear the list. The styles are split up in several files.
