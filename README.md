# Project Todos

Create a to-do list using React and Redux. Learn in more depth how to use actions and reducers to create the store.

## The problem

This week was very much a code-along with Max. I have however learnt more about reducers and feel more confident in my knowledge. If I had more time I would have worked on more functionality: a list of completed tasks, completing all tasks at once and a prompt asking if you really want to delete a task.
