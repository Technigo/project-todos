# Project Todos

This week was a very busy week considering me moving and easter. I learned a lot and had some challenging times but I think I managed to create a decent project.

I would have liked to spend more time to figure out global styling and also on the custom checkboxes. Unfortunately the styling had to be a little neglected this week but I'm still proud of my work!
