# Project Todos

This week we built a to-do app using React and redux-toolkit.
We created new slices, new reducers and actions. And talked about what immutabilty means.

## The problem

I started out by doing a design sketch in Figma followed by some notes on each step the app should do.

Then I started with selecting data from the store using useSelector and dispatching data to the store depending on the users actions.
After that I created the components ToDoList that toogles the list and AddTask that lets the user do just that. When this mean functionalitys were in place I added header and also decided to use a Wrapper component to keep App clean.

I wanted to spend some more time on styling this week and tried to follow my sketch to the minimum. I styled everything with styledcomponents, it all worked out nicely but could use a lesson on the optimal way of structuring it.

If I had more time I would have added a Completed page for the tasks to drop down to when done.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
