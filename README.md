# Project Todos

In this week's project, I have built an todo application using redux.

## The problem

In this todo app, I have created some different tools for the user, such as adding todos, list the tasks and toggle whether a task is done or not. Each task have a remove button and at the top of the page there's a delete all button. 

Some strech goals I aimed for: 
- add a 'clear all' button
- add a timestamp to tasks
- use styled components

If I had more time I would add categories to the tasks so the user can filter on different categories.
