# Project Todos - Week 15 at Technigos bootcamp

The brief was to create a todo app. In the app you should be able to add tasks, list tasks and toggle weather a task is done or not. I choosed to create a toread app, with books I want to read and have read.

During this week we learned:
- How to structure a redux store
- How to write reducers and actions
- How to interact with your store using selectors or by dispatching actions

## The problem

 I started this project by creating a clear sketch in Figma, with all the components written down before the start, which made it easier to visualize the flow of Redux. It was a good way for getting to know my vision and the result ended up pretty similar to the sketch. I learned how to customize the input style by transforming it to a div, which I'm glad for and will apply to future projects.

 If I had more time I would have created a library with reusable components. I will save that thought for a bigger project.
