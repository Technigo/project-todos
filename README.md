# Project Todos

Todolist built in Redux with reducers. 
You can add tasks, list tasks and toggle whether a task is done or not.
You can also delete a task or all tasks and set every task done.

## The problem

I started off with a figma file to plan my week and draw some wireframes.
This week I spent some extra time on design and figma, made some icons matching the image in the header.
When I have time I will make a local storage and solve a bug with the check all button. I would also like to add another slicer for filters.
