# Project Todos

This project was made by me week 16 in the Technigo bootcamp. 
The assigment was to make a "Todo-app" in Redux.


## The problem


My biggest struggle with this project was with using style-components for "classnames". If i had more time I would use props and really give it a shot. My solution was to use style components for the functions and style the classNames in Css.
