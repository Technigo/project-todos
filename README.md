# Project Todos

This project aimed at creating a todo list using redux toolkit. The application contains a input and add function, a display of all the tasks, a section that displays the completed tasks, and a counter showing how many total amout of tasks and how many completed tasks have been made and be able to toggle between done and undone.

## The Features

- Mobile, tablet and desktop responsiveness
- Use of React framework
- Use of global state using redux hooks: useSelector - - and useDispatch
- Use of react hooks such as useState

## The process

- the lerning objectives for this project was to create new reducers, new action and how to structure a redux store, how to interact with it by dispatching actions and understanding the redux-toolkit role.

- I started out with a simple idea of the todo list, focused a lot on understanding the setup of the store and to import the fuctions into the separate components.
- due to somewhat lack of time I was not able to implement the function to be able to categorise the so this is something that I would continue doing.
- Another thing that I would add is a empty states UX design.
