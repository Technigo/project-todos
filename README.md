# Project Todos

Create a to-do list using redux.

In the list you should be able to:
* list all tasks - completed or uncompleted.
* be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncompleted).
* be able to add and remove tasks.
* should show a count of either all tasks or all uncompleted tasks (or both).

## The problem

I started by creating a sketch of the different components, figuring out which needed to do what.
I choose a design from behance to have as inspiration for my own layout.
I used redux and styled components to structure it. I feel like I got a better understanding of the Redux state by doing this project.

If I had more time, I would look into adding more functionality like due date, filtering completed/uncompleted and adding categories.
