# Project Todos

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.
The project is to create a To do app which allows users to add, remove tasks and check if they are completed or not. Todo web app is developed with React-Redux and styled-components.

## The problem

At first, it was hard to understand Reducers, payload as well as to decide which to put in the local state. After practising readux with similar project: shopping-cart, Redux, reducers become clearer now.
It is very helpful too learn how to use spread operator and immutability concept. To make the project better, I should have put a timestamp into each task.
