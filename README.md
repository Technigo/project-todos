# Project Todos - https://sammys-todo.netlify.app/

## 🏁 Goals:
I was tasked with building a to-do app using Redux, and I'm proud to say that I successfully completed the project.

The app has three main functionalities - adding tasks, listing tasks, and toggling task completion status. I decided to keep the design simple and clean, as I know that prospective employers may be interested in seeing this project.

Overall, I found this project to be a great opportunity to flex my Redux muscles and bring together all the different parts of Redux. I'm thrilled with the end result, and I'm looking forward to using the skills and knowledge I gained from this project in future endeavors.

**Must-have requirements**:<br>
✅ List all tasks - completed or uncompleted.<br>
✅ Le able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncompleted).<br>
✅ Be able to add and remove tasks.<br>
✅ Should show a count of either all tasks or all uncompleted tasks (or both).

## 🧨 The problem:
I started with creating a design sketch in Figma - the plan was to create a minimal and lightweight app.
Then I set the structure with components and reducers.
I used styled components for the most part of the styling in this project. 

If I had more time, I would add a "Complete all" button.
