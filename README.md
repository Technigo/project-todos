# Project Todos 

 / https://mrsucodesproject15todo.netlify.com/
 
An application which pulls together all the parts of redux by building a todo app.

Im be able to add tasks, list tasks and toggle whether a task is done or not. 

## What I learned 🧠

* How to structure a redux store
* How to write reducers and actions
* How to interact with your store using selectors or by dispatching actions


## Requirements met 🧪

* The app should list all todo tasks - completed or uncompleted
* Able to mark an uncompleted task as complete
* Able to change a completed task back to uncomplete
* Able to add new tasks
* The app should show a count of either all todos, or all uncomplete todos
* Code follows Technigo’s code guidelines.

## Stretch Goals 🏃‍♂
