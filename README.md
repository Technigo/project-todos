This was an assignment made on the Technigo bootcamp. 

# Project Todos
The assignment was to make a todo app in React using Redux, learning how to structure a redux store, how to write reducers and actions, and how to interact with the store using selectors or by dispatching actions. 

I made a todo app that is responsive, shows how many tasks are unfinished, and with buttons that can check all tasks and delete all checked tasks. When there aren't any tasks left a text and animation is shown.

## Techniques used:
* HTML
* CSS/Styled Components
* React/JSX
* Redux/Redux Toolkit
