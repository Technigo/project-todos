# Project Todos

The assignment was to build a todo app to add tasks, list tasks and toggle whether a task is done or not. 
Required techniques were Redux and React.

## The problem

Everyone has an opinion on what makes a decent todo app, right? I for sure have. I want mine to be more of a note-taking app than an endlist list-of-things app. I structured the assignment from start to be a multi-page todo app, with an add-form and an edit-form. To still keep it simple and hold the five days deadline I kept the styling minimal and clean. While I prepared for a sorting on chosen categories I did not implement it on the list page. In the end, I added local storage so it can be used some. I had so much fun building this app and would love to do it again!
