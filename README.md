# Project Todos

This week we built a to-do app using React and redux-toolkit.
We created new slices, new reducers and actions. And talked about what immutabilty means.

## The problem

I started out by doing a design sketch in Figma followed by some notes on each step the app should do.

Then I started with selecting data from the store using useSelector and dispatching data to the store depending on the users actions.
After that I created the components ToDoList that toogles the list and AddTask that lets the user do just that. When this mean functionalitys were in place I added header and also decided to use a Wrapper component to keep App clean.

I wanted to spend some more time on styling this week and tried to follow my sketch to the minimum. I styled everything with styledcomponents, it all worked out nicely but could use a lesson on the optimal way of structuring it.

If I had more time I would have added a Completed page for the tasks to drop down to when done.

I will move the add button.
