The goal of this project was to build a todo app using Redux store, writing my own reducers and actions.

Features

- Responsive UI for mobile, tablet and desktop
- Redux hooks: useSelector, useDispatch

Made custom checkboxes for the first time, very happy I got it to work.

Looking forward to contiuing my work with this app, adding more functionalities in the future!
