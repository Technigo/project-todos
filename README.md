# Project Todos

A todo project in Redux where you can add, complete and remove your tasks.

## The problem

First time using redux to this extent, which was quite a bit of fun but also challenging to say the least. It's rather intuitive, but it takes a lot of time and repetition to get familiar with its workings.
I started off by trying to go top to bottom, one component and reducer at a time. I ended up only using Redux and moment.js, apart from the obvious HTML/CSS.
If there was more time I would spend a lot on it improving the UX, as the UI jumps aruond a bit during add/remove; it's jarring. For an initial project I guess it's okay. :) I would also destruct the components into more of them and utilize styled components rather than standard CSS.
