# Week 14: Project Todos

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem

* add category / icon depending on category
* add deadline
* delete one / delete completed / delete all
* toggle complete/pending one/all
* undo delete (one or all)
* display all/completed/pending
* search to filter by text/category
* timestamp when created
* count
* styled components
* list items sortable/droppable

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
