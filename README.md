# Project Todos

This week's project was an individual project focusing on the following point in Redux:
- How to create new slices
- How to create new reducers
- How to create new actions
- What immutability means and how to work with it
- How to structure a redux store
- How to interact with your store using selectors or by dispatching actions

## The problem

The app has the following features:

- Toggling completion of tasks, a button to complete all tasks.
- Adding and removing tasks.
- All todos and all uncompleted and completed todos.
- Each task has a created timestamp and a due date. If the task becomes overdue the due date changes to 'overdue'.
- Filters to display completed/uncompleted tasks and different projects.
- Task can be assigned to project which then can be filtered to show only that tasks that are assigned to a specific project.
- Main filters (complete all, ongoing, done) are only targeting tasks in the filtered prpject.

Styling:
- React styled components
- npm packages for navbar, dropdowns and popup window when creating a new task.
