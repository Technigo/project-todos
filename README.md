# Project Todos

This is a Todo-site. Here you can create lists, add tasks to each list and mark tasks as done or clear a list.

It's really nifty!

## The problem

This Todo-app lists tasks which you are able to mark as complete or uncomplete. You can remove tasks and add new ones, these are stored in the local storage is your browser. At the top you can see how many tasks you have in you list and how many you've completed.

Each task has a timestamp on when it was created using moment. The list also contains a 'Clear All'- button, on which you can remove all tasks from the list. The whole project is styled using styled components.
