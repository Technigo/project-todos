## 1. What is this?

For this project I kept practicing Redux, so I've decided to build a To-Do tool using a global store.

## 2. What did I do?

For this project I've defined a Redux store and a reducer with some actions, like setting a new task, setting it as completed and clearing all completed tasks.
We've used selector to get from the store the values of all tasks.

## 3. Where can you see it in action?

You can see the project [here](https://pedantic-archimedes-f69b06.netlify.com/).
