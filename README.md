# Project 15 - A todo list in React Redux

Project week 15 @ Technigo Bootcamp 2020 was the time to flex our redux muscles and build an application which pulled together all the parts of redux by building a todo app.

In my todo app, you are able to add tasks, list tasks and toggle whether a task is done or not.
