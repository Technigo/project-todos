#Project Todos 📝

The main goals of this project was build an application which pulls together all the parts of Redux by building a To Do application. In this app, the user should be able to: add and remove tasks to the tasks list and toggle whether a task is completed or not.

#Planning & What I learned 🧩

I started by sketching a rough structure of my app and how I wanted it to look like, as well as, which features I wanted to build. I wanted it to be simple and easy to use.

For this project I also implemented styled components 💅 for the styling.

This project was a real challenge but it was super fun to build.
