# Project Todos

This project was made with React and Redux by implementing a TODO list.
You can add new task, remove it, selected as done and select all.
All the local state is stored in LocalStorage to persist the info every time you reload the app

## The problem

In this project I didn't have too many problems, I understood all the flow with Redux. In addition, I have added persistence with local storage to redux
If I had more time I would like to reach Black Level and add unmark all selected tasks
