# Project Todos

n this week's project, we were building a todo app in Redux.

Requirements


✓ Your app should list all tasks - completed or uncompleted.

✓ You should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncompleted).

✓ You should be able to add and remove tasks.

✓ Your app should show a count of either all todos or all uncompleted todos (or both).

## The problem

I used my Figma template to plan the week and project. This week took some time to learn Figma (how to create components) and I also built my own icons and played with design more than I usually do.
I spent some time on reading redux documentation before getting stated, which was helpful in understanding the concept.
If I had more time I would clean the code and finish the Set All done button and play with filters.
