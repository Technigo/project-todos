# Project Todos

This project is about creating a React Redux todo app with the functionality to add, list, and toggle tasks whether a task is done or not. 

## How I solved it - What I learned

- This is my first project working with Styled components. I found styled-components effective, structured, and reusable. In my project, I created a folder named styled-components to keep all my components together. 
- I created localStorage to keep all my todos saved, even when the page is reloaded. 
- In my header, I am showing real-time and date. This functionality I created with help of moment.js, useState and useEffect.
