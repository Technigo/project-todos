# Project Todos

This project was part of Technigo Bootcamp and the assignment was to create a Todo app using React and Redux Toolkit. Basic requirements included ability to add remove and check tasks off the list.

## The problem

Since this was the first time using React Toolkit and creating my first reducers I struggled a bit in the beginning to understand where to start and how to approach. Once I understood how to create one reducer I was able to create the rest quite quickly and was able to spend more time on creating nice styling and conditional rendering.
