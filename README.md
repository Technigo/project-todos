# Project Todos

Tha task was to build a To-Do app using React and Redux Toolkit. We were free to implement our own design. 

## The brief

In this week's project, it's time to flex your redux muscles and build an application that pulls together all the parts of redux by building a to do app.

**What you need to do**

✓ Your app should list all tasks - completed or uncompleted.

✓ You should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncompleted).

✓ You should be able to add and remove tasks.

✓ Your app should show a count of either all tasks or all uncompleted tasks (or both).
