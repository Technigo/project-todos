# Project Todos

This is a simple and clean todo-list build in React and Redux. 

## The problem

The biggest challenge for me was the structure of the Redux store. I also chose to use styled components for the first time in a project. In the end, I thought that both the Redux store and styled components showed to be very useful once set up. When I have more time I will add more features to the todo-list, such as calender view and also tags/filtering.
