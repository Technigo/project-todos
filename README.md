# Project Todos
This is a simple todo app for the web made with React and Redux. In the app you can add tasks to a list and toggle whether a task is done or not. You can also see how many tasks are left to do and clear all tasks. If the task list is empty there is an empty state message.

## What did I do?
I started with planning what the app should be able to do, what components to use and what kind of data to store.

I made a rough sketch of what I wanted the app to look like. I opted for a minimalistic design.

Something that I would try to add if I had more time is local storage so that state would persist between browser sessions. I would also add some more functionality to the form, with options like due date and categrories.
