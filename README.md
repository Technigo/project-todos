# Project Todos

Project was to practice making your own reducers and slice in Redux by creating a To-Do list in React. 

Demands for the project:

✓ Your app should list all tasks - completed or uncompleted.

✓ You should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncompleted).

✓ You should be able to add and remove tasks.

✓ Your app should show a count of either all tasks or all uncompleted tasks (or both).

## The problem
 
 My aim for this project was to create a Bullet Journal-inspired app where the user can pick different symbols for a couple of categories of tasks. 

 I had a hard time figuring out just how to structure my code in each component, which i guess will have to take some more projects before i get a feeling for. At the level im currently at in my learning process i aim to make it as simple as possible to not have my code spread out too much. But next time i think i will go for working more with styled components to make the code more reusable and effective.
