# Project Todos
This project was made during week 16 of the Technigo Bootcamp. The task was to build a Todo-app using Redux.

Goals:

- How to structure a redux store
- How to write reducers and actions
- How to interact with your store using selectors or by dispatching actions

## The problem

I started with building the basic functionality such as displaying tasks and checking them. Then I proceeded to styling which is a never ending story.. 

Thereafter I did functionality such as being able to delete items, and making them crossed out after checking them.

I am really happy about that I have learned to use ternary operators and conditional classes, so I practiced this a lot in this project. 

If I had more time I would implement more functionalities, such as letting the user choose color-theme and maybe edit the todo:s.
