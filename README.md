# Project Todos ✅
In this week's project I flexed my redux muscles and built an application which pulls together all the parts of redux by building a todo app.

## What I've learned 🧠
 ✔️ How to structure a redux store
 ✔️ How to write reducers and actions
 ✔️ How to interact with the store using selectors or by dispatching actions

## View it live
