# Project Todos

This project was done during week 11 of Technigo's Boot Camp. It was about creating a to-do list in React, using Redux, making our own reducers and implementing functions that are relevant for a to-do app.

## The problem

I started off by sketching up a mobile version of the app using pen and paper, to figure out what I wanted the app to look like, what functions I wanted and what components I need. With that done I headed into VSCode and started by making a new slice to store my to-do tasks and used a hardcoded list of tasks to get going. After that I made every reducer and action that I needed and with everything working as I wanted I made the styling using styled components.

### Tech
