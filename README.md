# Project Todos

In this project im creating a TO-DO app in react Redux.

## The problem

I coded along with a similar project and watched how other people had solved this task. Then I made a Figma sketch to set up the components needed. I discussed Redux a lot with my team this week and also watched some great videos recaping the Redux functions.

If i hade more time I would have made the Tasks into a calendar.
