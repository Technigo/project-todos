# Project Todos

A todo app made using React Redux. Thoughts can be added, marked as completed and removed from the list. The list can also be filtered and cleared.

## The problem

The initial structure is made following the example from our teacher. I have added the filter and remove all functionalities to the app and decided to use Styled Components for the styling. I decided not to include a timestamp for each todo, instead I used moments to display today's date in the summary section.
