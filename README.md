# Project Todos

My fist from-scratch Redux-App. Creating a To do-list were you should be able to add new tasks, delete tasks.

## The problem

I struggled and still do a lot with Redux and the passing of information. I struggle still struggle with useEffect and useState and now also dispatch, actions and stores.

I thought about adding a delete-all-button, but didn't find the room in my design. So maybe I'll check in on that later.
If I had more time I would obviously put more love into the "design", but this is where it landed this time.
