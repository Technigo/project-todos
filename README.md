# Project Todos

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

This project was all about using the state to store and change data. We got introduced to slice and how useful redux can be. The mission was to create a simple todo list that stores and updates when you add a new to-do.

## The problem

The problem i had was how to add objects to my slice and how to use them in the components. I looked at other projects and used the techniques i saw there. If i had more time I probably would've added some categories for my todos.
