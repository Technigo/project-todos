# Project Todos

Built a to-do-web-app where you can add tasks, tic them off as done and remove them when you want to clear the list. 

## The problem

Used React and Redux to store and change the state. I found it both easy and tricky at the same time, I enjoy Redux but had a hard time using the reducers and actions.
