# Project Todos

I created a todo list using Redux. I needed the app to list all tasks (completed or uncompleted), to be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncompleted), to be able to add and remove tasks and to show  a count of either all tasks or all uncompleted tasks (or both).

## The problem

I began by thinking about which components I would need. I then set up the reducer and continued from there. My stretch goal this week was to use styled components. I also wanted to use some animation so I imported a React Confetti package. I used a date-fns package to create a date on the app, and if I had more time I would also have added a timestamp to each task when added.
