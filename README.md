# Project Todos

I have created a todo application using React Redux. You can add new tasks, delete tasks, filter on category and choose your own color theme!

## Features and Issues

I really enjoyed this project! I think a lot was due to the fact that I truly discovered how great and fun it is with all the libraries out there. It's been so much fun just trying out many different things that the libraries provide. It's been very time consuming though, playing around and trying out different things and changing my mind 100 times this week. But I'm happy with how the project turned out, even though I feel like I could have spent a lot more time on it to add more cool features. Might actually do that later on!

I've used Material UIs Drawer for both the header (where you can choose your color theme) and for the footer (holds the form where you can add new tasks). I've also used Dialogs from there for the delete buttons. Downloaded and used sweetalerts first but then decided it would look better if it was more aligned with my own design and theme! 
I have added categorys for the tasks, possibility to clear all tasks, delete all, due date that turns red when passed, and filter on category. I also added a local storage :) 

I went with styled components to and am starting to really enjoy that!

My biggest issue and the thing I also spent the most time on was probably the color theme. It took so much time to make them all work together so all the themes would look good. I had set my mind on having that feature so really wanted to get it to work nice. I also had a lot more code there in the beginning with more functions, but managed to cut that down significantly which was nice. There was a lot of googling and just trying my way out. 

I also spent some time structuring the project. I wanted to break down the components as much as possible and googled some about the best way to structure. I don't know if I've done it in a good way, but it was a lot clearer for me and easier to find everything when I created more folders!

If I had more time I would have made it possible to create your own projects/categories and also filter on dates.
