# Project Todos

Simple Todo list web app made to get familiar with Redux.

## The problem

Fun project that helped me understand  Redux, reducers, the useSelector and useDispatch hooks better. I was moving this week so I was a bit short on time, that's why I decided to keep it rather simple. There was a lot of functionality I thought of that I didn't have time to even try to implement (like sorting tasks after category, date added etc.). 

Still a great learning process and I'm looking forward to work more with Redux.
