# Project Todos

This week's project was to make a Todo-list for adding, deleting and completing tasks in a list using Redux actions. The project is written in React.

I started off by planning my project in a simple overview in Jamboard:

I added some extra functionality for showing a cat image with different expressions for each action. I also added styled components with animations, and custom checkboxes. Lastly I decided to add extra functionality for deleting all tasks.

If I had more time I would add more features like changing the header text based on actions, functionality for deleting all completed tasks, and cat expressions based on inactivity in the app. I would also re-write the cat expressions functionality since there is a lot of duplicate code.
