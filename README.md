# Project Todos

The assignment was to build a to-do app using React Redux, with the possibility to add and remove tasks. 

## The problem

I started out with reading up on what parts I would have to use to create the app, to get a grasp of the "machinery" of the code. Then I sketched on the design of my app, getting an overview pf the different parts and components I would need. When all the basic components were on place and working, I dived into the details and looked at extra features that I could add. If I had more time, I would really like to add localstorage, so that the tasks are saved and don't dissapear when you refresh the page.
