# Project Todos

This is a to do application that uses local storage to save your very own to do list. There are two tasks already created at the start to show the design of the posts, but thanks to local storage, once you delete them they won't come back. It's also possible to add new to dos as well as delete created ones. You also get a date stamp when the to do was created. When you check a to do as complete it will be sorted to the end of the list of all tasks.

## The problem

The tools used for this project was redux and it's my first project writing reducers. What I like most about the project is the use of redux localstorage which had a very quick implementation.
I'm using a combined css and styled components, the styling for the checkboxes I would like to adapt from css to a styled component to have all the styling in one place.

The planning for this app was unfortunately quite inadequate and I paid for that at the end when I was struggling with the design of it. In the future I will always create a rough sketch, at the very least, because it took much longer to get the layout and design when I had no idea what I was aiming for. 

If I had the time I would like to add functionality for grouping tasks together into projects as well as make it possible to check all tasks as complete.
