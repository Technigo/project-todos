# Project Todos
The assignment was to build a to do list web application with Redux. The user should be able to add new, delete and toggle between tasks. 

## The solution
-
- If I had more time on this project I would like to add more functionalities to it. It would have been nice to add the possibility to edit tasks and also add some kind of timestamp to each task. A button for "clear all tasks" would also be great for the user experience.


## Tech
- React 
- Redux
- JSX
- CSS
