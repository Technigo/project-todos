# Project Todos

This project is to make a todo-list using React and Redux.

## The problem

I started by creating the outline of the app. Then I created the reducer. The project is divided into components using React. The app is styled using styled components. When I have more time the next step is to make a local storage so the todos stay even when refreshing the page.
