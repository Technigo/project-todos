# Project Todos

In this week's project, I have built my first todo app by practicing my Redux skills.

## What I have learnt

* The role redux-toolkit plays
* How to create new slices
* How to create new reducers
* How to create new actions
* What immutability means and how to work with it

## The process and structure

I almost reached the **RED LEVEL** ðŸ”´

I don't have a placeholder when there are no Todos.

This week started off good I think and I did a raw sketch of what I wanted, a header with title and information how many todos left. In the main section, which is my Todo list I have a form to add a todo and then all the todo items are listed. At the bottom is a footer with filter options.

**Known issue** (let's see if I will be able to fix it)

* Filter options - You have to click twice to get it to work

I have used styled components and I think it's has been a challenge for me to find a good structure and what to call things and how much can you re-use without beeing limited. Which I have felt some times. So yes it's good to re-use stuff but also hard to see a good pattern.  

### Core Tech

* React
* React Redux
* Redux Toolkit
* Styled Components
* Reusable Elements
