# Project Todos

This week's assignment was to build a todo-list in Redux. The site should:
- list all tasks - completed or uncompleted.
- be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncompleted).
- be able to add and remove tasks.
- should show a count of either all tasks or all uncompleted tasks (or both).

## The problem

I used Redux to make this project.
If I had more time, I would add a "complete all" button and categories.
