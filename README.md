Project done during the Technigo Bootcamp

# Vacay Planner Project

The project was to do a todo web app using Redux, where you can add, delete and set tasks as done and not done.
I turned it into a vacation planner.

## The problem

I started by deciding how to structure the site with its different components, as well as the design and color scheme.
First I did the ToDoList, Input and Header and after I got everything to work I added the NoToDos which is what is displayed when you first open the app or when there are no to-do's left. For this page I also used a Lottie animation.
The Vacay Planner lets you add tasks, toggle between done and not done, set all tasks to done or not done plus remove all tasks.
I found a solution to create a custom checkbox which turned out OK but it needed some work to be able to tab and check/uncheck.
After I had a finished project I did styled components instead of styling it in the CSS file. The custom checkboxes I left in the CSS file because I couldn't figure out how to convert it to styled components.
