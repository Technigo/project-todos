# Project Todos
This assignment was to create a to do list. you should be able to turn on and off complete, add more todos and count the amount of items.

## The problem
I would've added a show and hide function for completed todos, style the checkbox, create a popper menu bar for more options and features for each item, as well as making the container scrollable if you have many items.
