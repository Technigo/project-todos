# Project Todos - Overview
Project done as a part of Technigo bootcamp.

<!-- description -->
In this week's project, it's time to flex your redux muscles and build an application which pulls together all the parts of redux by building a todo app.


Learning Objectives:
- How to structure a redux store
- How to write reducers and actions
- How to interact with your store using selectors or by dispatching actions

<!-- ## Approach-->


<!-- ## Core Tech
- CSS
- API
- React
- React Hooks
- JSX -->



## Requirements Completed
ðŸ”µ  Blue Level
- Your app should list all todo tasks - completed or uncompleted
- You should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncomplete)
- You should be able to add and remove tasks
- Your app should show a count of either all todos, or all uncomplete todos (or both)

<!-- ðŸ”´  Red Level (Intermediary Goals) -->
<!-- - Add a timestamp for each task indicating when it was created. Timestamp should be displayed as formatted date, but stored as raw date. You can either use built in JS functionalities or [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) -->
<!-- - Add a **clear all** button to set all tasks to *done* status. You could also use this opportunity to make your app look nice when there's no data. SeeÂ [empty states UX design](https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/empty-state-ux-design)Â for some ideas. -->
<!-- - Use styled-components instead of vanilla CSS to do your styling -->

<!-- âš«  Black Level (Advanced Goals) -->
<!-- - Add a date input to your new task form to set a due date on a task. It could be required, or optional - it's up to you. You could then display this in the list and style it differently when a task is overdue. -->
<!-- - Add filters to display completed/uncompleted tasks, tasks created after a given date or anything else you consider important. -->
  <!-- Hints -->
  <!-- Often, when approaching things like this in redux, it's common to use the redux store to save the current filter and dispatch actions to change it. You can then use that state in your selector to decide what todos to return from the selector. -->

<!-- - Create categories/tags for tasks so they can be grouped - for example, 'Housework', 'Shopping', etc. -->
<!-- - Create projects for tasks â†’ A project could be a group of tasks which all need to be completed and when they are completed, the project is marked as complete. -->
