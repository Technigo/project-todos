# Project Todos

A minimalistic to-do app with an input field and two columns to organise tasks according to 'outstanding' or 'completed'.

## About

The app was built with React and Redux, with a heavy reliance on global state management to make all the features and functions play nicely together. It uses Styled Components, DayJS for date checking/formatting and uniqid for generating a new ID for each task. 

At a later time, I plan to add persistence to the app, which would allow me to replace the to-do app I currently have on my phone with this one.
