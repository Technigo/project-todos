# Project Todos

This week we where tasked with creating a Todo-list website, in React Redux
where you can add todos and remove them as you please.

## The problem

I learned more about redux, and how the get and send information to the "store". 
The problems where making it work, making so you can add todos and remove them.
I watch the live session, and googled. 

If i had more time:
- i would add a timestamp for when the todos were created
- and a remove all button to get a clean state
- i would put more effort into styling
