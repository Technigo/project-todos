# Project Todos

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem
Lottie and SweetAlert
The role redux-toolkit plays
How to create new slices
How to create new reducers
How to create new actions
What immutability means and how to work with it

- How to structure a redux store
- How to write reducers and actions
- How to interact with your store using selectors or by dispatching actions

- Your app should list all todo tasks - completed or uncompleted
- You should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncomplete)
- You should be able to add and remove tasks
- Your app should show a count of either all todos, or all uncomplete todos (or both)
- Add a **clear all** button to set all tasks to *done* status. You could also use this opportunity to make your app look nice when there's no data. See [empty states UX design](https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/empty-state-ux-design) for some ideas.


Use styled-components instead of vanilla CSS to do your styling
Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
