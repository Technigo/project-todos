# Project Todos

This is a todo list there you can write down your tasks, complete them and delete them, to organize your life

## The problem

This project is made with React and Redux, with a store and reducers to update the store. I started with making a design for how I wanted it to look and see what kind of components I needed and went from there. There are some styled components aswell as the usual CSS as styling. For the future I would love to add some categories so that you could cluster the tasks.
