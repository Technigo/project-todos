# Project Todos

This project was Technigo's boot camp project for week 14. Goal was to build a to do -app, where user is able to add tasks, list tasks and toggle whether a task is done or not. 

## The problem

Page requirements:
- Your app should list all todo tasks - completed or uncompleted
- You should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncomplete)
- You should be able to add and remove tasks
- Your app should show a count of either all todos or all uncomplete todos (or both)
