# Project Todos
A todo-app built with Redux.

## The problem

Use all the parts we´ve learned of redux and build a todo-app. 
Started with a sketch to get an overview of components, what logic there would be and styling.
The project gave the opportunity to practise on a lot of things we´ve done earlier, such as date and, more recent, more kinds of React hooks.
I choose to work with styled components to practise on that too.
Really fun project! If I had more time I would to try to sort the tasks on completed and uncompleted, and make the "all check"-button toggle.
