# Project Todos

Built a To Do app with Redux and React. This app lists all the todos and allows users to add new todos.

## The problem

The first thing I focused on was creating slices, reducers, and actions with Redux. Once that was done, 
I created all the different components and then fetched the list of todos and mapped over them to display
each todo. From there I added checkbox inputs with fuctionalities to toggle todos from being complete or 
incomplete. I chose not to create custom checkboxes because I didn't want to make them inaccessible. Lastly
I added reducers that would delete one todo at a time and a reducer to clear all of them.
