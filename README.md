# Project Todos ✔️✔️🖊️

The goal of this project is to build a To Do application with the following functionalities: add/remove a task, list a new task and toggle between done/not done. 
This had to be achieved by using Redux and and Redux's state to manage features and create my own store with reducers and actions. This was achieved by using **Redux Toolkit**.
