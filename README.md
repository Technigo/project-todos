## ✅ The brief
Week 11 of @Technigos bootcamp. I was challenged to build a to-do app using Redux.
It needed to be able to add a task, list all new tasks and toggle between completion status.
This was a very educational project for me and gave me a better insight and understanding of how to use Redux and the possibilites it has.

Must-have requirements:
✓ List of all tasks - completed or uncompleted.
✓ You should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncompleted).
✓ It should be possible to add and remove tasks.
✓ Should show a count of either all tasks or all uncompleted tasks (or both).

## 🏔️ The problem

I started creating a design in Figma with the intention to keep it clean and easy to use. From the design I sketched on what components I needed and how to structure the assigment.  I wanted to use styled components as much as possible during this project.

If I had more time to put into this I would've looked into normalizing the default style cause I did not manage to override that. I would also add a timestamp for each new task and worked more on some alignments of elements.

Overall I am happy with the end result and looking forward to use and expand my knowledge regarding Redux!
