# Project Todos
I created a To do list using React, Redux and various node packages. 

## The problem

First I worked on the functionality of the list mostly focusing on how to create the reducers to fetch what I wanted from the store. Then I did a little design work to make it look the way I was hoping. I am dissapointed in how the calendar is placed but fixing that is for another week when I have more time.
