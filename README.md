# Project Todos

This was a project I did when attending Technigos frontend bootcamp. The assignment was to build an todo application using all the parts of redux.

## The problem

We got a lot of help with the basic set up of the app. I tried to add some extra features but ran out of time so I sticked to the basic version.
