# Project Todos

The goal for this project was to learn how to create reducers and implement Redux without being provided pre-written code.  Additionally, I focused on planning and improving the way that I used Styled Components.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I began by planning out the project according to the given goals and stretch goals.  I created a (very) rough design to guide the initial stages of coding, and planned out coding steps that aligned with specific reducer actions.  This enabled me to create a basic functional to-do list quite quickly. Once the basics worked, I started adding some additional functions and features to reach stretch goals. Then I styled the project. Finally, I added some conditional styling for overdue tasks, and an additional action to allow the user to sort tasks by category.
