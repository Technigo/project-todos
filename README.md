# Project Todos

Assignment was to create a Todo app managing the global state with Redux.

## The problem

Since Redux was to be used it took me a while initially to figure out how to use the global state, but after that it was quite smooth to get all the basic functionality working (adding tasks, mark done etc etc.)

For the second time in the course I decided to use Material UI (MUI). This time I got to understand it much better and happy that I made the decision because it's so powerful! Things like responsivity are (mostly) taken care of and setting up accordions for the different due dates of the todos was now a breeze compared to if I would have hard coded it.

Styling is still a bit tricky with MUI - I wanted to add a dark theme but couldn't get it to work after hours of hours of trying, in the end used mostly styled components to customize the look and feel.
