# Project Todos

This was a project created with the purpose to pracitce Redux, and React and styled components as well. It is a simple Todo-list with a post-it look. You can add and remove tasks, as well as check them as complete and uncheck them. You also can see how many task you have completed of the ones in the list.

## The problem

This project was very straight forward. I started by looking though the material and the lessons provided. I wrote the code I needed to make the functionality to work first and then did the styling. I decided to do styled components instead of writing it in the CSS file to practice. I wanted to give a post-it note feeling to the app and spend some time to make it look hand-written. I didn't run into many difficulties with this project, but peeked at others code on GitHub to get some inspiration. I googled the information I needed to do the custom styled lines and add fonts in components, and easily found what I needed on GitHub, W3Schools and articles at Mozilla and DEV.
If I had more time I would like to have custom styled the checkboxes a bit, and add a filer for completed/uncompleted tasks, to check them all or remove all and a time stamp and due date perhaps.
