# Project Todos

In this week's project I flexed my redux muscles and built an application which pulls together all the parts of redux by building a todo app. In the app, one can add task, list tasks and toggle whether a task is done or not.
## What I learned

How to structure a redux store
How to write reducers and actions
How to interact with the store using selectors or by dispatching actions
## View it live
