# Project Todos

In this project the assignment was to create a to-do site, using React and Redux, to add and display a user's tasks. These could be unchecked and checked, deletable and so on by using selectors to get information from the store and dispatching actions to update the store.  

## The problem

After going through the week's video lessons and reading material I started the project by going through and following Damien's shopping store code-along and did an initial setup of the components my to-do site needed and started trying to implement functions by setting up my store and writing my own reducers. Then the Tuesday live code session with Daniel was very helpful to code along to and get to the next step in selecting stuff from the store and dispatching things to it. In the beginning of the week I felt confused about how the Redux flow worked but somewhere in the middle of the week it kind of "clicked" and I started to grasp it better and were able to add more reducers such as removing all tasks. 

I didn't have any exciting design idea in mind when I started the project and since Redux is still pretty new I didn't want to focus too much on that but in hindsight I think I would have saved some time if I decided on a sketch from the beginning, although that's easy to say afterwards. If I had more time I would work more on the design and add a timestamp and maybe some more stretch goals.
