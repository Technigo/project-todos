## Production Process

- I started by planning the functionalities and layout for the project and dividing those into components.

- Creating reducers was a new concept and this was a great oportunity to add different functionalities.

- The filter for completed and uncompleted tasks was initially creating conflits when published on Netlify, but after changing it to the tasks file in the reducer, the conflits were solved
