# Project Todos
This project was made during week 16 of the Technigo Bootcamp. The task was to build a Todo-app using React and **Redux**.

## The problem
The project was to build a todo application with the functionality to add and remove tasks, display the number of todos and the possibility to check a todo.

I started by doing a breif sketch of the application to determine which components I needed, the flow of the components and their responsibilities. Then I thought about what data I wanted to display in the application, and thus how I needed to set up the Redux store.  There after I started to build the basic functionality such as displaying tasks and checking them. 

When I was done with the basic functionality I did the styling, and also implemented different styling depending on the state of a task (checked/not checked). I am really happy about that I have learned to use ternary operators and conditional classes, so I practiced this a lot in this project. 

If I had more time I would implement more functionalities, such as letting the user choose color-theme and maybe edit the todo:s.
