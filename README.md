# Project Todos

This project was made during the Technigo bootcamp. The project was about creating a todo app with the functionality to add, list, delete and checkmark tasks. The application pulls together all parts of redux. 


## The problem

To hold the five days deadline I decided to keep my to-do app simple. I tried to keep the styling minimal and clean. I got a lot of practice in how to structure a redux store, write reducers and actions and to interact with the store using selectors and dispatching actions.

I created localStorage to keep all my todo's saved when the page is reloaded.

If I had more time I would go for a "check all" tasks, and also adding due date/time.
