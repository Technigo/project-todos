# Project Todos

The goal of this project was to build a todo app using Redux store.

## The problem

I had no problem getting the basic functionalities to work, adding/removing tasks and toggling between completed/uncompleted. I have gotten into the habit of using a Trello board to keep track and structure my tasks, which works very well. I challenged myself to also add different filters. My approach for this worked, but it was overcomplicated and hard to read, even for myself. After I had gotten feedback from a code coach, I was able to refactor this part of the code. For me it was very giving and encouraging to be able to discuss my approach with a senior developer.
