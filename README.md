# Project Todos

This is a React Redux app that allows you to manage tasks. You can add, remove, and mark tasks as completed or uncompleted, and the app will display a count of all tasks or all uncompleted tasks. Redux Toolkit is used to manage state and provide functionality such as creating slices, reducers, and actions, as well as working with immutability and structuring the store.

## The problem

I checked past projects for ideas, completed a Technigo e-commerce project, sketched my own design, selected necessary components and features, and utilized ChatGPT and forums for npm packages and code snippets. Ideally, I would have utilized styled components instead of index.css for the background image if given more time.
