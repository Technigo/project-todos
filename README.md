# Project Todos

This weeks project has been about using Redux and creating slices, reducers and actions, hence learning how to structure a Redux store to interact with. It was done as a solo project.

## The problem

I did not percieve there to be many problems that I could not overcome if I would have more time. I did paint myself into a corner, codewise,
when trying to get a hamburgermenu to appear at a certain screen width to be able to toggle the input areas and did not manage to get that to work.

If there is one thing I would have liked to put more time into it would be sorting the styling into seperate components. The styled components outgrew some of their current components and would have been better put into a seperate, global CSS.js-file.
