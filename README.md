# Project Todos

In this week's project, we have build an application that pulls together all the parts of redux by building a todo app.

## The problem

Redux is a big challange but a lot of fun when you get the hang of it (not sure IÂ´m there yet) Started with watching all the tech material provided and then I handled the project with a lot of help from the team sessions and from people in my team.
