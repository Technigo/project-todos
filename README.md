# Project Todos
Basic todo app with childish design and state management in Redux.

## The problem
Created two state slices, one for unfinished tasks and one for finnished tasks. The app passes the tasks back and forth between the two. There is also an unstasking function for clearing the schedule and go doing something fun!
