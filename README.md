# Project Todos

The brief was to use Redux and React to create a to-do list app.

## The problem

I ended up using React-Router as well, and implementing local storage. I can create multiple lists, toggle them as complete or incomplete, delete the tasks, edit the tasks, or delete the entire project lists. Also added aria labels and tabbing to make the site accessible.

Lots of challenges and bugs I managed to fix. Would like to have implemented a drag-and-drop as well for the tasks. Let's see if I have time to implement it.
