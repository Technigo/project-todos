# Project Todos
This week we built a to-do app using React and redux-toolkit.

## The problem
I started with a sketch with figjam so I could see how many components I need and what information I need in my reducer.  
After that I started out with adding my components and reducers and completing them one by one. I used styled-component which i couldn't use in last project.
If I would have had more time I would try customized checkboxes.
