This is a simple To Do funktion were you can create a list of things to do and mark them as clear when you ate done. You can also follow how many to do's you have left and clear the list.

I did create one Reducer called ToDoList and components for each part. All the components are in use un eachother or in app.js.
I used selector, dispatch and state in different components to render new information and functions.
