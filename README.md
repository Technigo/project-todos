# The Daily Planner

This week's project is to use redux and build an application which pulls together all the parts of redux by building a todo app.

## The problem

Mostly problems came up because of lack of basic knowledge of Redux as I dived in right away into the subject. However, I solved it by Google lots of solutions, searched through StackOverflow and the most important is to let myself rest and restart.
