# Project Todos

Build an todo application with all part of redux.
Structure a redux store, write reducers and actions. 

## The problem

This week I had alot of time to plan and structure my project.
The planning went like this:
- Sketching down which components i wanted
- Gathering and writing down what data/information i wanted to store in my redux store
- What kind of reducers and actions i wanted to dispatch. 
- Designing in Figma how I wanted my app to look and feel like. 

After i started with my plan and finnished up with all of my components, reducers and actions I decided to add Material UI for buttons and checkboxes. Once i was finnished with the structer and my plan i decided to add more components from a UX perspective. Having a start screen, adding a navigation bar, without function though, and also adding more functionality to the "clear all" button. Enabeling it to work with clearing and unclearing them all. 

I must say that all these structure and planning ahead helped me to keep my calm and work on the project with joy. This week has been so fun!

If i had more time i would add date to each todo and work more on the stretch goals. Especially styled components!
