- Complete Task
- Auto save to local storage

Tech:

- HTML5
- React
- Redux

## The problem

This was a great exercise to practice working with Redux, a great but sometimes a bit daunting tool. I had a joy building the app.

Took me a bit of time to figure out the local storage to work with my reducers. Did not see the solution to update the whole store on removing of item in the list.

### Whats next / Known bugs

I wanted in my design in figma be able to hide and show the UI of the input field but had to skip it due to lack of time.

Known bug: The completed counter wont show the correct value when removing items and the number of tasks is less than completed ones

I will return to this and remove this section ðŸ˜‹
