# Project Todos

This weeks project was to build a to-do app by using React toolkit. In the app you can add todos, remove tasks, toggle todos depending if it's completed or not and also see how many todos you have completed and how many you have left to do. There is also buttons for remove all tasks and to remove all completed tasks. 
By using local storage the local browser remembers all the todos you have listed in the app.

## The problem

This weeks project was lots of fun but also very challenging. I started to structure how the code should look like and later on by sketching what design I would like.
The 'List' component stores all the other components and the component maps through the tasks :point_right: that gets added by the 'AddTodo' component. It's in this component the user adds their todos, which displays in the :point_right: 'Item' component, where the maped data from the 'List' file displays each todo. 
On each todo the user have the option to toggle the task as completed/not completed and to remove the task. The 'List' component maps through the tasks and show some other information regarding the tasks and the buttons.

:art: I styled the document with styled components.

This weeks biggest challeng has been related to struggles with visual studio code which has taken a lot of time from building the app itself but it is also a great learning.
