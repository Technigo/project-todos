# Project Todos

With the help of React-Redux I created this simple to do list which displays:

- Current date
- Amount of tasks in total
- Amount of tasks completed
- Amount of tasks left
- Input field and submit button
- Local storage
- Checkbox if completed, delete button if deleted
- Date of when the task was created.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

\*\*- Your app should list all todo tasks - completed or uncompleted

- You should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncomplete)
- You should be able to add and remove tasks
- Your app should show a count of either all todos, or all uncomplete todos (or both)\*\*

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
