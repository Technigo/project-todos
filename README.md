# Project Todos

This project is done within Technigo frontend boot camp.

A project with the objective to practice Redux Reducers and Actions, and pull together all the parts of Redux we've been touching on.

## The problem

It seemed straight forward to start with, but was more complex than I thought, and there were several ways presented how to solve the project. I focused on getting the basic functionality to work, and also practice using styled components. The CustomCheckbox was a project of it's own! Finally I added local storage, to store the latest data in the users browser. If I had more time, I would add an accordion to hide the Add todo input field, and also a date picker to set a due date for each task. I would also work on the styling some more.
