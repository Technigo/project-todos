# Project Todos

This week's project was to create a To-Do-App with the main focus in Redux on the below parts:

How to create:
* New slices
* New reducers
* New actions

We also went through what immutability means and how to work with it.
Added to the above things we also worked with the structure in a redux store and how to interact with the store using selectors or by dispatching actions.

## The problem

The app has the listed features below:
* Adding and removing tasks
* All to-dos and uncompleted/completed todos
* Each to-do has a timestamp and a date

I tried to work with React styled components in this project and I feel it went better than last week's project so that's a progress! =D
