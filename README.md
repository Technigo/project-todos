# Project Todos

This weeks project was about creating an app using redux. The app was supposed to se a todo list were it is possible to add tasks, remove them, mark and unmark them as completed. 

## The problem

I started my project by sketching out what components I wanted and what each of them should do and how they would be connected to each other. Then I continued by coding the reducers, actions and selectors. I then created the different components and conected most of them in the TodoList.js. I then finished by creating the styling with styled components.
