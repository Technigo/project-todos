# Project Todos

The project assinment was to create a ToDo app using React and Redux.The application should have the following functionalities:
• list all todo tasks - completed or uncompleted;
• user should be able to mark an uncompleted task as complete (and change it back to uncomplete);
• user should be able to add and remove tasks;
• the app should show a count of either all todos, or all uncomplete todos (or both)
• each task should have a timestamp indicating when it was created.
• styled-components should be used instead of vanilla CSS

My extra touch to the project was to add a time-varying Greeting text and image.
