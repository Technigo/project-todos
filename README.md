# Project Todos

Mission was to to a To Do app using Redux and write our own reducers and actions.

## The problem

I started off by writing with paper and pen, all parts and how they should work together, based on the brief. Installed all dependencies for our project and then I started to code in VS Code, and used Chrome inspector to see the result. 

It was/is a very fun project "to do" and I would like to work on this more, hopefully learn how to connect to backend.

I added a little responsive design, some styled components and decided to leave a few lines in the list from start. Used moment.js for time.
