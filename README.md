# Project Todos

From the Technigo BootCamp I got an assigment to create a ToDOo App.
I can add and delete my tasks that I need to keep track of.


## The problem
I have built the project with minor issues, but with some help from my team,
the lectures, google, SO I solved them.

I did get stuck on styling the checkboxes and if I had more time I would continue to fix them.
