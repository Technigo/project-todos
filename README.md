# Project Todos

This project is a to-do application built using React and Redux to manage the state. The goal of this assignment was to create an efficient and user-friendly task management system where users can add, mark as complete or incomplete, and remove tasks while keeping track of task counts.

## The problem

To approach this problem, I started by planning the application structure and breaking down the components and state management. I used React to build the user interface and Redux to manage the state of the application. The combination of these two technologies allowed for a predictable and maintainable system. During development, I followed best practices for organizing my code and managing the application state.

The primary tools and techniques used in this project include:
JavaScript, React, Redux & styled components.

With more time, I would have focused on improving the UI and UX of the application, adding more features such as task filters, deadlines, and user authentication.
