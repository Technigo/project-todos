Description

In this project I built a Todo web-app. In the app you can add tasks, list tasks and check whether a task is done or not. 

What did I do?

I structured a redux store. In the store I wrote reducers and actions and made sure that the store interacted with the store using selectors or by dispatching actions

Im very proud of the  "Good job!" ternery since we all need a little cheer in our lifes. If I had more time I would of added more CSS to the check-buttons, because i want them to keep their mesurements when being clicked.
