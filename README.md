# Project Todos

A Todo application where you can list all the things you need to take care of.
You can then check them off your list an later on even delete them. It will also show how many tasks you have left todo and
counts the one you checked off as 'done'
An app built with React Redux with focus on creating reducers and new actions.  

## The Approach 

I tried to sketch this as thoroughly as I possible could. 
Then I started with the header and worked my way from there.
