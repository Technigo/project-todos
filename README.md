# Project Todos

A "To-do" app built in React Redux, using Redux-toolkit and Styled components.
Focused on creating slice, reducer, action, how to structure a Redux store and interact with the store using useSelector and useDispatch.
In the to-do app, you should be able to add tasks, list tasks and toggle whether a task is done or not.

## The problem

Did a few codealongs to get used to how to set up a Redux store and creating reducer. Googled different To-do apps for inspiration. Added an extra column - Status, for practice.
If I got more time I would try to add filters to display todo/in progress/completed quests and/or sort the quests.
