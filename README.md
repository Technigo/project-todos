# Project Todos ‚úèÔ∏è

A todo-app built with React and Redux. The app lists all todo tasks - completed or uncompleted. A state of each todo can be shown as either done or not done with a checkbox. New todos are added using a text field. Todos can be removed one by one or all at once using the clear-all button. After pressing clear-all, a warning alert box appears asking if user wants to clear all or cancel that action. The app also counts and shows how many of the listed todos are done.
