# Project Todos

The task was to create a todo app in Redux.

## The problem

I solved the problem by learning how to:
* structure a redux store
* create a slice
* create reducers and actions
* interact with the redux store by using selectors or dispatch actions

If I had more time I would have looked into displaying date when the task was created and maybe set a due date for when it's supposed to be completed.
