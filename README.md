# Project Todos

This project was about creating a todolist and using React and Redux. 

## The problem

I started with setting up the store with initial state and creating the reducers and actions and started with one component, TodoList. Once I got the store working I mapped different things that I wanted to display in the list, such as list items. After that the functions of removing items, adding items etc was implemented and more components were added as needed. React-redux toolkit, useDispatch, handle functions, filter method and styled components were the tools and techniques used to approach to this problem. If I had more time I would have liked to add more filtering based on prio and would have done conditional rendering to show a "Well done Page" in case all the tasks are done. I would have also improved the styling.
