# Project Todos

This project was to create a todo app for practising Redux.

## The problem

I started by plan the app. Created then the reducer, TaskList, AddTask and then continued with components I found needed due to my plan. Finally added the styling. And then finally made the custom checkboxes. Now I will never forget that the label and the input have to be connected correctly. 

I would like to be able to change the order of the task and change the color of the checkmark accordingly to the order and the gradient boarder.
