# Project Todos

Mission was to make a To Do app using Redux and write our own reducers and actions.

## The problem

I started off by sketching with paper and pen, all parts and how they should work together, based on the brief. Installed all dependencies for our project and then I started to code in VS Code, and used Chrome inspector and Redux Devtools to see and test the result. I first focused on the functions and not the design.

I later moved my code via Home.js just to start thinking "multi pages" and not always use App.

I later added a little responsive design, some styled components and decided to leave a few lines in the state from start.
I did some reading about "createGlobalStyle" in Styled Components and tried using it. I tried a lot to make a "toggle switch" but didn't have the time to get it to work properly.

This was/is a very fun project "to do"!
Later when I have time I will work on adding a datepicker, checkbox/toggle switch (as styled component) and hopefully connect this to a backend.

_I'm aware of all my comments left in the code and they are supposed to be there for now, so I can pick this up easily, now and then. I used a different branch during development and I know the code should be clean when released but this is work in progress and it's working great for me at the moment._
