# Project Todos

This weeks aim was to continue our Redux learning by creating our own Redux store and reducers from scratch. The task was to build a To-Do app, using Redux store.
Requirements: The app should allow the user to list tasks, add/remove tasks, toggle when a task is complete/incomplete, show a count of to-dos.

## The problem

I started by creating a brief sketch to give me an idea of the layout and what basic components were needed.
I created and configured my **Redux Store** with an **initial state**, as I wanted to display some default tasks. I decided that I wanted to style my app with **styled components**, as I found this technique quite confusing and I wanted to understand it more.

I'm happy that I now have a good understanding of how to create and use **reducers**, as they seemed pretty confusing last week.
If I had more time I would of researched more into local storage and implemented it into my app. That way any task amendments would save on the users browser.

Other tools used: I implemented a date and timestamp using **Moment**, an alert when you click on the "Clear All" button using **Sweetalert**, **Redux Toolkit**.
