# Project Todos

This week's bootcamp project was to make a todo-app with the help of Redux; learning how to create slices, reducers and actions, how to interact with the store and how to write immutable code.

## The problem

I planned out most of the features I wanted and their placement and what would need reducers before I started coding. I made two slices, one for active and one for saved todo-items. The app doesn't have the option to save, because I hit a problem with this that I couldn't solve within the given time. If I had more time I would fix that, and give the CSS a big clean up.
