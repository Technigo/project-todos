# Project Todos

Working with Redux global state in a To do-app that can add, remove and clear all tasks. It will also provide an empty state if you're finished with everything 🌻📖✅🙋‍♀️

## Code
I've used:
  * **Redux**
  * **React.js**
  * **JavaScript**
  * **CSS**

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
