# Project Todos

This week thw project was to build a to do app in Redux with the functions to add, complete and remove tasks from the to do list.


## The problem

I started with planning how I wanted the page to look, what functions I wanted it to include. After that I added the functions and applied the design after making sure the tasks could be added, removed and checked as completed. If I had more time I would have put more time in to making the styled checkboxes to work. I also wanted to add a filtering function to display completed and not completed tasks.
