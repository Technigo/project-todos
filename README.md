### Learnings

This week was all about diving deeper into Redux and read from/write to the global state. Started out being extremely confused about everything regarding reducers, action, state, store, selector, provider, and god knows what. Still very confused about these things, but I managed to piece something together and (sort of) understand how it's all tied together.
