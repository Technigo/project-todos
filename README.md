# Project Todos

This week, I deep dived into global states with Redux approach.

I struggled with understanding local state and global state. I learned the hard way by trying to use global state (Redux store)
to update one local thing in one local component (the information is not shared with other components) and that's why I took me a really long time to try to make it work. Now I understand React Hooks and Redux better. 

Users should be able to:
1. view the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
2. add and remove tasks with a corresponding tag
3. toggle a task to make it as done
4. see the number of incomplete tasks
5. filter the tasks based on their status
