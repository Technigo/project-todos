# Project Todos âœ“
This project was all about creating a Todo-list in React, using Redux, creating our own reducers, and implementing all functions that are relevant for a Todo-app.

## The problem
I started off by sketching a mockup with pen and paper to figure out what functions I wanted, what components I would need and an overall basic take on layout. Heading into VSCode, I created a pretend todo-list to use while constructing the app. Having built all basic html construction and very basic styling with Styled Components, I gave the Redux dispatch/actions a go. After managing to get "Add new task"-function to work it felt like the rest of the project went by really smooth.

Turns out I really like working with Redux, and even though many things were new to me, I feel like I was able to try all sorts of things out. By the end of the project I could focus more on zooming in on each action, making sure I understand exatcly what I have done and why. Immutability is still a bit fuzzy for me, though. I found this project to be very valuable regarding handling arrays, using map, filter and find a lot.

If I'd have more time, I would like to look into how to work with custom alerts, reminders and setting deadlines using dates, also being able to export/import tasks from/to desktop/mobile etc. Maybe it would have been nice practice to let the user add its own categories, and by doing so also updating the filter by category-functions.
