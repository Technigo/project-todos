## The problem
My biggest issue is naming the different functions and during the programming process missing details in the spelling, or if I change as I code. This affected the synced components and created a redo of a lot of code and costed me time. So coming projects I have learned to print out fullnames of my own understanding instead of thinking short words/namings = better practice. 
This project also made me notice my increased understanding of styled components, so next time I will create Globalstyle-file instead of adding it into exisiting components to clean up the code more.

I solved most of my problems thanks to 1:1 meeting with Technigo and through other and former student's. Also Stack has been helpful during this project, and a great deal and googling.

## View it live
I chose to go by my style of liking which is simple, earth friendly vibe so I enjoyed having that freedom.
