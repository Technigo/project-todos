# Project Todos

This week I have build a to-do app with redux. In the app you should be able to add tasks, see a list of task and toggle whether a task is done or not.

## The problem

I started out by drawing it all up on jamboard so I could see how many components I needed and also what information I should have in my reducer. I also draw how I wanted my app to look like. After that I started out with adding my components and reducers and completing them one by one. This week I also tried to make some styling with styled components. If I had more time I would add a image when you have no tasks left.
