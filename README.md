# Project Todos

This week I made a Todo app using Redux as a weekly project for frontend development bootcamp at Technigo.

## The problem

I started with making the structure of different folders and files (reducers, components, library for styling purpose). I tried to make use of React components such as Datepicker and ToggleDisplay. One of the problems I had was that the date object Datepicker uses is non-serializable and it caused the app to crash. I asked for help at StackOverflow and got suggestions on using either JSON.stringify() or moment.js to reformat the date object. 

If I had more time, I would have worked on how to order the tasks in relation to how much time is left until their due date.
