# Project Todos

This was a project I did when attending Technigos frontend bootcamp. The assignment was to build an todo application using all the parts of redux.

## The problem

We got a lot of help with the basic set up of the app. I tried to add some extra features but ran out of time so I sticked to the basic version.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
