# Project Todos

In this week's project, flex your redux muscles and build an application which pulls together all the parts of redux by building a todo app.

- How to structure a redux store
- How to write reducers and actions
- How to interact with your store using selectors or by dispatching actions

## The problem

With the help our code coach we broke down the given design of the web app and diveded it into components and initial structure of store, reducers

- reducer, store, slice (tasks.js)
- components, header, taskform, tasklist
- css to pull it all toghether

Some extra tweaks like importing currentdate with, day.js and created a filter for displaying number of completed tasks and made use of react icons
