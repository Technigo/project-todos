// Consistency in store.items = something. Return initialState is returning. Returning instate
// would not work due to already items. Otherwise, empty array, that would work.

// initialState could also be written as an object instead of outside of const (slice).
// Store as a reference, referencing the initialState and its content, and then we need
// an action. If we want to add something, we get it from a component. To make clear
// that the function takes an argument from a component, we need the action. Can be banana.
// Remember that the first argument references the state of the store, the second argument
// references the data that is passed down from a component.
// Now we push.
// Pushing is the mutable approach. What are we pushing inside our items array? Inside our
// items array we need to push the data that will be from the component/the user.
// store.items.push(action.payload)
// Mutable = Modifying original items array. The action has two properties, the type of
// this action ('pokemons' addPokemon) and the payload (everything we're passing down
// from addPokemon.js/from any component). When we want to access any data put into our
// reducer we need to acces it with action.payload. When you mutate the state of the store
// you might get a browser/peer warning since whenever we do operations on initialState/Store
// we are changing it for several components. We want everything to be the same until the
// time of the operation of us mutating it/pushing the data is over.

// Immutable approach = Assigning a new value for the whole items array instead of modifying
// it. Instead of attaching something, like with the push, to the end of our array we're
// assigning a whole new value. First it references itself (store.items), then references
// the action.payload. Expecting content of array.

// const x = ['a','b','c']
// const y = [x, 'd'] => [['a','b','c'], 'd'] If not using the spread operator.
// const z = [...x, 'd'] => ['a','b','c','d'] The spread operator takes the square
// brackets and removes them, putting everything inside of one array.
// const superObject = {a: 'test', b: 'other test'}
// const supererObject = {...superObject, c: 'third test'} The spread operator can
// also be used to add a property to an object.
// Spread operator removes nested array, you get the data but it is flattened out.

// Filter is not enough to create a change by itself. Good to display things inside
// state variable but not for permanenting deleting. Semantics.
