// The mapStateToProps function maps the taskCount and
// uncompletedTaskCount properties from the Redux store state to the component's props.
// taskCount is the total number of tasks in the todos array,
// and uncompletedTaskCount is the number
// of tasks in the todos array that are not marked as complete.
// The TaskCount component displays the task count using two paragraphs. The first
// paragraph shows the total task count, and the second paragraph shows the count of
// uncompleted tasks.
// The connect function connects the TaskCount component to the Redux store,
// allowing it to access the taskCount and uncompletedTaskCount properties from the store.
