# Project Todos

To create a to do list using redux toolkit.

## The problem

I started off by making a sketch how the project would look like and how it would be organized / structured (with dropdowns collapsing)

Then I started building all basic functionality, like adding items to the list and deleting items, later moved on to sorting items, depending on if they were completed or priority.

When all that worked I moved to trying to create projects from scratch: arrays inside an array. In order (I don't know if it is the best way) to set a project name for each array I placed the arrays inside objects inside the 'main' array.

I used the redux dev tool a lot and stack overflow. 

If I had more time I would work on structuring the project better.
