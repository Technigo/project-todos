# Project Todos

I created a classical ToDo-List with React/Redux, using the Redux store to save my daily Todos. For this project I build a responsive starting page and a tasklist.

## The problem

In this project I created my own slice and redux-store for the first time. I created several reducers that I use for injecting/removing data into/from the store or sorting the todos (completed are moved to the end).
I used again Styled Components and performed conditional rendering in different parts of my code (eg colouring of different ToDos dependent on category).

Learnings from this project:
- The role redux-toolkit plays
- How to create new slices
- How to create new reducers
- How to create new actions
- What immutability means and how to work with it
- How to structure a redux store
- How to interact with the store using selectors or by dispatching actions
