# Project Todos

This week's project was to create a to do app in Redux.

## The problem

I started by figuring out which functionalities I wanted to add to the list, and plan the basic structure of the app. I then created the component where the tasks are being kept, and added the possibility to add a task, and also mark a task complete. After that basic functionality was added, I started working on the styling, and made a plan for how I wanted it to look like. I decided to add a header and a footer component and to position the content with help from Flexbox. 
After having the basic logic that made it possible to add a task and show the excisting tasks, I also added one button to mark all complete, and a button to unmark all tasks. In addition to that, I also added a counter, to show how many of the tasks that has been completed. 

What I found most challenging this week was to grasp the difference between immutability and mutability and how to think about it.

What I'm most proud of this week is that I quite easily could process the way to work with useDispatch and how to filter and then use the filtering in a good way. I am also happy that I could process the information from the lectures and then use that to build other features.
