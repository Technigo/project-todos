My reflections on how this week's project turned out:

This week I learned a lot about Redux and how powerful it can be. Also about mutability and immutability, which
I think is a complex concept to grasp. 

Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail:

I would really like mutability and immutability explained in more detail. For example I had a specific bug in
my code, which I know was because of a mutability problem. Inside my map method where I was mapping all the 
todos, I could not display a timestamp for the time each todo was created at because the timestamp was being
mutated each time a new todo was created.
